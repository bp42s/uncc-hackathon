        <p>Welcome to <strong>Niner Market</strong>! Our platform is designed specifically for college students, offering a sustainable, student-focused marketplace. Here, you can buy and sell everything from clothing and tech gadgets to dorm essentials, making sustainable choices convenient, affordable, and impactful for our campus community.</p>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Our mission is to foster a sustainable, circular economy on campus by encouraging students to choose pre-owned items. With Niner Market, you can find items you need and sell items you no longer use, creating a community-driven space where sustainability meets affordability.</p>

            <h2>Why It’s Useful</h2>
            <p>Niner Market is built for students’ unique needs, especially during transitions like moving in or out of dorms. It’s the perfect place for third-year students moving out to sell furniture, clothing, or electronics, and for new students to find essentials at budget-friendly prices.</p>
